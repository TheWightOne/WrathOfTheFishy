  popupText: "Osywnn\u2019s Life in H\xE4vf\u012Fsk\nLong ago, Oswynn was a farmer
    living at the seaside village of  H\xE4vf\u012Fsk. Besides fruits and vegetables
    that were grown, the village consumed fish from the sea.  Fish were considered
    divine gifts from the ocean god and goddess Aegir and R\xE1n. If one were to
    not eat the fish, it was viewed as sin for denying their blessing. Oswynn never
    ate a single fish and was looked down upon by his neighbors, especially by the
    fishermen. The fishermen had the highest ranking positions in the village and
    were believed to be messengers of Aegir and R\xE1n, holding the values and expectations
    the village people were meant to have. Oswynn was considered by them as weak
    for having a woman\u2019s job and was ridiculed even more for choosing to be
    the sole vegan in their omnivore society. He understood he would never be admired
    or praised by the people of H\xE4vf\u012Fsk so he took matters into his own hands.
    Oswynn packed all of his things and moved to the Forest of Sinnsr\xF8, vowing
    to himself that he would stay true to his beliefs."
