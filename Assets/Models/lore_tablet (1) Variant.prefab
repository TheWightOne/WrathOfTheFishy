  popupText: "Oswynn\u2019s New Life in the Forest of Sinnsr\xF8\nOswynn lived comfortably
    in his new home and considered the dwellers of the forest as the friends he never
    had. He always shared food with the creatures and protected them from any hunters
    that would come by. One night, he was approached by the night goddess Moona,
    who had noticed all the good deeds he had done to help the animals of Sinnsr\xF8.
    She suggested that with the kindness Oswynn had in his heart, he could earn a
    spot in the gods and goddesses\u2019 Hall of Heroes. He doubted himself for a
    moment but was reassured by Moona that she would help him get stronger.  Ever
    since then, Osywnn trained every day under the guidance of Moona with the goal
    to become a true hero and finally be respected by the people of H\xE4vf\u012Fsk."
